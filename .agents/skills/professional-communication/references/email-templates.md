## Tips for Using Templates

1. **Personalize** - Don't send templates verbatim; adapt to context and relationship
2. **Delete irrelevant sections** - If you don't have blockers, don't include a blockers section
3. **Match formality to relationship** - Adjust tone based on how well you know the recipient
4. **Proofread** - Especially names, dates, and any copied content
5. **Consider timing** - Avoid sending at midnight or over weekends unless urgent
