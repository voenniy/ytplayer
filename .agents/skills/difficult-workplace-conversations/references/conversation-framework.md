# Difficult Conversation Framework

Complete guide to the three-phase framework for challenging workplace conversations.

## The Three Phases in Depth

### Phase 1: Preparation (40% of Success)

Most difficult conversations fail before they start. Thorough preparation dramatically improves outcomes.

#### Step 1: Clarify the Facts

##### What happened? (Objective)

Write down only observable facts:

- What did you see or hear?
- When and where did it happen?
- Who was present?

##### What story am I telling? (Subjective)

Notice your interpretations:

- What assumptions am I making about their intent?
- What conclusions have I jumped to?
- What emotions am I attaching to the facts?

##### Exercise: Separate Facts from Interpretations

| Fact (Observable) | Interpretation (Story) |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| "John submitted the report 3 days late" | "John doesn't care about deadlines" |
| "Sarah interrupted me twice in the meeting" | "Sarah doesn't respect my opinions" |
| "Alex didn't respond to my email for a week" | "Alex is avoiding me" |

#### Step 2: Identify Your Contribution

Even in situations where you feel wronged, consider:

- What did I do (or not do) that contributed?
- Did I set clear expectations?
- Did I provide necessary resources/support?
- Have I modeled the behavior I expect?
- Did I address early warning signs?

This isn't about blame - it's about taking ownership of what you can control.

#### Step 3: Understand Their Perspective

**Questions to Consider:**

- How might they see this situation differently?
- What pressures or constraints are they facing?
- What might be their positive intention (even if the impact was negative)?
- What do they care about that I can acknowledge?
- What would they say if I asked them to describe what happened?

**Empathy Exercise:**

Complete these sentences:

- "If I were in their position, I might..."
- "They might be feeling..."
- "They might want..."
- "They might be worried about..."

#### Step 4: Define Your Goal

**Three Goals to Clarify:**

1. **Outcome Goal:** What specific change do I want?
2. **Relationship Goal:** How do I want us to relate after?
3. **Identity Goal:** Who do I want to be in this conversation?

**Goal Framing:**

| Ineffective Goal | Effective Goal |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| "Make them apologize" | "Understand what happened and agree on prevention" |
| "Prove I'm right" | "Share my perspective and understand theirs" |
| "Get them to change" | "Explore how we can work together differently" |

#### Step 5: Choose Time and Place

**Timing:**

- Not when either party is stressed, rushed, or emotional
- Not right before/after high-stakes situations
- Allow enough time (30-60 minutes minimum)
- Not on Fridays (no time to follow up)

**Location:**

- Private, neutral space
- No power imbalances (not your office if you're the boss)
- Away from distractions
- Comfortable (seating arrangement, temperature)

### Phase 2: Delivery (The Conversation)

#### Opening (First 2 Minutes)

The opening sets the tone for everything. Get it right.

**Bad Openings:**

- "We need to talk about your performance..."
- "I've noticed some problems..."
- "I've been meaning to tell you..."

**Good Opening Formula:**

```text
1. State purpose: "I'd like to discuss [topic]"
2. Share your intent: "My goal is to [understand/resolve/improve]"
3. Invite partnership: "I'd like to hear your perspective too"
```

**Opening Templates:**

For Performance:
> "I'd like to talk about the project timeline. My goal is to understand what's happening and figure out how I can better support you. Can you share your perspective on how things are going?"

For Conflict:
> "I wanted to discuss what happened in yesterday's meeting. I'd like to understand your viewpoint and share mine so we can work together more effectively. Is now a good time?"

For Feedback:
> "I have some feedback about the presentation. My intention is to help you succeed, and I'd also like to hear your thoughts on how it went."

#### The Conversation Body

##### Structure: Share → Listen → Explore → Resolve

##### 1. Share Your Perspective (2-3 minutes)

Use this formula:

- **When** [specific situation/time]
- **I noticed** [observable behavior - no judgment]
- **The impact was** [effect on you/team/work]
- **I felt** [your emotion - optional]
- **I'd like to understand** [invitation to respond]

Example:
> "When the client presentation was last week, I noticed the slides weren't ready until the morning of. The impact was that I didn't have time to review them, and I felt anxious going in unprepared. I'd like to understand what happened on your end."

##### 2. Listen to Understand (5-10 minutes)

Your only job here is to understand their perspective.

**Listening Techniques:**

- **Paraphrase:** "So what you're saying is..."
- **Clarify:** "Help me understand what you mean by..."
- **Acknowledge emotion:** "It sounds like you felt..."
- **Validate:** "That makes sense because..."

**Questions That Deepen Understanding:**

- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What was going through your mind when...?"
- "How do you see this differently?"
- "What do you wish I understood?"

##### 3. Explore Together (10-15 minutes)

Look for:

- Points of agreement
- Underlying interests (not positions)
- New information that changes your understanding
- Shared goals

**Exploration Questions:**

- "What do we both want here?"
- "What would success look like for both of us?"
- "What's getting in the way?"
- "What haven't we considered?"

##### 4. Resolve and Agree (5-10 minutes)

Get specific:

- **What** specifically will change?
- **Who** will do what?
- **When** will it happen?
- **How** will we know it's working?
- **When** will we check in?

**Agreement Template:**

```markdown
## What We Agreed

**Actions:**
- [Person A] will [action] by [date]
- [Person B] will [action] by [date]

**Check-in:**
- We'll touch base on [date] to see how it's going

**If issues continue:**
- We'll [next step]
```

#### Handling Difficult Moments

**If They Get Defensive:**

- "I can see this is bringing up strong feelings"
- "I'm not trying to attack you - I want to understand"
- "Let's slow down. What's your main concern right now?"

**If They Deny or Deflect:**

- "Help me understand how you see it differently"
- "What would you need to see to agree there's an issue?"
- "Let's focus on what we can both agree happened"

**If You Get Triggered:**

- "I need a moment to think about that"
- "I'm feeling defensive - can you help me understand your point?"
- "Let's take a 5-minute break and come back to this"

**If You Hit an Impasse:**

- "We seem stuck. Can we agree on what we do agree on?"
- "What would help us move forward?"
- "Would it help to bring in [neutral party]?"

### Phase 3: Followup (Ensuring Change)

#### Immediate Followup (Within 24 Hours)

1. **Send written summary** of what was agreed
2. **Thank them** for the conversation
3. **Reaffirm commitment** to the relationship

**Email Template:**

```text

openness in sharing your perspective.

#### Scheduled Followup (Per Timeline)
